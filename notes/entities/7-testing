Making the test aware of the implementation details or the state is "bad".
Dont make "common knowledge" the lines of the SalesInvoice for example.
The tests should justify the production code and every production code should be justified.

Dont expose all the state. Change setters to actions.

# Tests for invariants and edge cases.
Expect argument exceptions.
Expect keywords from exceptions.

# State transitions
Expect logic exception.
The red book is more complete about domain events. Although sometimes there doesnt implement
the events inside the entity, it goes around.
