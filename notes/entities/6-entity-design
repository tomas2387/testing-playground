If the object changes it needs to be identifiable.
Since the entity is something that tracks changes on time, we should
create it with the identification. Provide it as a constructor argument (UUID).
Different ways of doing: integer, uuid, wrapped in VO. Even we can call the db for a sequence.
Redis has a nice implementation for the next incremented number: INCR
Regardless of which type you use, you should use a VO, so that you dont care about the
implementation behind it, you just need an id.

The repository provides the next identity.
