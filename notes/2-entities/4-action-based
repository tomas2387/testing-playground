We should change setters to actions.

Should we have state as a value object? yes?

setIsCancelled(true) -> is actually changing the whole entity.
All of the others behaviours are disabled!

The need for changing from a setter to an action (setFinalize to finalize)
is a command, is a new face to life. Also you cannot do setFinalize(true) and then
setFinalize(false). Is not something we can undo.
