assertSame('USD', $money->currency()->toString());
We are coupled to the internal properties of the value object

// versus
assertEquals(new Currency('USD'), $money->currency());
This is better

// or even better
assertEquals(new Money(100, new Currency('USD')), $money);
This is better than better. We are testing the object that holds a superior behaviour.
