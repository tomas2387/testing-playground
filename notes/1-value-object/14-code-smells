Shotgun surgery
- You do the same everywhere. Rounding everywhere. And when change is needed you have to change in scattered places.

Duplicate code

Data clumps

Primitive obsession

Lazy class
- A value object that does nothing.

Speculative generality
- You get it when people say, "Oh, I think we need the ability to do this kind of thing someday"
and thus want all sorts of hooks and special cases to handle things that aren't required.
The result often is harder to understand and maintain. We want generality when we really need it.
